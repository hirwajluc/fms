## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't Login
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the correct email and password:
- Email: `admin@greater.org`
- Password: `password` (all lowercase)

### Issue: Dashboard Shows All Zeros
**Solution:** This means there's no data in the database yet. The system is working correctly - you just need to add expenses and timesheets.

### Issue: "Access Denied" Error
**Solution:** You're trying to access a page your role doesn't have permission for. This is working as intended!
- Members can't view expenses
- Members can't approve timesheets
- Coordinators can only see their institution's data

### Issue: Database Connection Error
**Solution:**
1. Check XAMPP - make sure MySQL is running (green light)
2. Verify database credentials in `/application/config/database.php`
3. Database should be: `Sql1800295_2` with user `root` and empty password

## 💡 Understanding the System

### How Roles Work:

```
Super Admin
   └─ Can see EVERYTHING
   └─ Manages all partners
   └─ Full system control

Admin
   └─ Can see ALL data
   └─ Can manage coordinators
   └─ System configuration

Institution Coordinator (e.g., Rwanda Polytechnic)
   └─ Can see ONLY Rwanda Polytechnic data
   └─ Approves timesheets from RP members
   └─ Uploads expenses for RP
   └─ Manages RP members

Member (Jane Smith at Rwanda Polytechnic)
   └─ Can see ONLY own timesheets
   └─ Submits timesheets to RP coordinator
   └─ Views own approval status
```

### How Data is Filtered:

**When Super Admin logs in:**
```php
// Sees ALL expenses from ALL partners
$expenses = get_all_expenses(); // No filter
```

**When Coordinator logs in:**
```php
// Sees ONLY expenses from Rwanda Polytechnic (partner_id = 1)
$expenses = get_all_expenses(partner_id: 1); // Filtered
```

**When Member logs in:**
```php
// Sees ONLY own timesheets (user_id = 3)
$timesheets = get_all_timesheets(user_id: 3); // Filtered
```
